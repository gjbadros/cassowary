	* ClVariable.h, .java: Added change_value memfn, and make it virtual
 	instead of setValue -- thus subclasses can specialize behaviour
 	when the variable gets set by the solver.

	* ClSimplexSolver.h, .java: Use change_value for setEditedValue if
	the variable is not in the tableau;  call resolve() before
	removeAllEditVars in endEdit

	* ClSimplexSolver.cc, .java (setExternalVariables): Use change_value
	instead of set_value when so subclasses can override and notice a
	changed variable

	* Added setEditedValue(), FContainsVariable(), and addVar() to c++ 
	and Java implementations

	* Fixed bug in C++ and Java in solvers lacking stay constraints
 	that was due to not-updating the external parametric variables
 	set.

Fri Jul 10 09:00:15 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Fixed bug whereby a dummy variable was being pivoted into the
	basis because pexpr->anyVariable() didn't guarantee the variable
	it returned was a pivotable variable -- now it's called
	anyPivotableVariable(), and does the right thing.

	* Fixed bug whereby column mappings that had no rows remained in
	the list of columns -- now erase the column key when its value is
	the empty set

	* Fixed bug whereby constraints that threw required failure
	exceptions remained in the tableau (a removeConstraint on a
	constraint that failed to be added used to succeed, now it does
	not)

	* Cassowary v0.1 is released  --- see local/POST-ANNOUNCE-TO for
	list of places where it was announced
