Thu Aug  6 20:56:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Release v0.2.

Thu Aug  6 20:41:40 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ClTests.cc: Added multiedit() test for testing nested
	  beginEdit-s

	* ClSimplexSolver.h, ClSimplexSolver.cc: Support nested
	  beginEdit-s -- use removeEditVarsTo(n), and rewrite
	  removeAllEditVars in terms of the former;  Use FIsSatisfied on
	  constraint and compare with testing internally for
	  FIsConstraintSatisfied() -- untested.

	* ClLinearInequality.h, ClLinearEquation.h, ClConstraint.h: Added
	  virtual FIsSatisfied

	* ClLinearExpression.h, ClLinearExpression.cc: Added evaluate()

	* ClAbstractVariable.h: Return 0 for value(), and make it a
	  virtual function.

Wed Aug  5 16:10:56 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ClStrength.h: Have ClStrength::symbolicWeight return a const
	  ref, instead of by value, make clsXXX const refs.

	* ClSimplexSolver.cc, ClLinearInequality.cc, ClLinearEquation.cc,
	  ClLinearConstraint.cc: Take ClStrengths by const refs

Tue Aug  4 15:22:08 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* guile/cassowary_scm.cc, cassowary_scm.hpp: Move all inline
	  functions into .hpp file.  Added cl-is-constraint-satisfied?
	
	* ClTableau.h: Added a rowExpression() const memfn, for
	  FIsConstraintSatisfied()

	* ClSimplexSolver.h, ClSimplexSolver.cc: Added (probably broken)
	  FIsConstraintSatisfied(cn) memfn -- needs testing

Sun Aug  2 16:49:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ClSimplexSolver.h: Added ConstraintMap() accessor to
	_markerVars, for cl-constraint-list guile primitive

	* ClConstraint.h: Added setPv(), Pv(), and _pv field to a
	constraint, for attaching extra information.

Thu Jul 30 19:15:40 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ClTests.cc: Added simple2, to test new EditMisuse exception on
	editing a variable that is nowhere in the solver.

	* ClTableau.h, ClTableau.cc:  Be more careful about inserting into
	_externalParametricVars; add FIsBasicVar to assist that care.

	* ClSimplexSolver.cc, ClSimplexSolver.h: Added pfnCnSatCallback -- 
	does nothing for now;  throw an ExCLEditMisuse exception if an
	edit constraint is added on a variable that is not in the tableau
	(needs at least a stay constraint in the solver); replace some
	calls to rowExpression with FIsBasicVar when the latter is the
	intent.

Thu Jul 21  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ClVariable.h, ClVariable.cc: Added _pv field, settor and gettor.

	
ABOVE CHANGES ONLY IN C++ IMPLEMENTATION AND ITS WRAPPERS
	
Fri Jul 17 19:24:54 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ClVariable.h, .java: Added change_value memfn, and make it virtual
 	instead of setValue -- thus subclasses can specialize behaviour
 	when the variable gets set by the solver.

	* ClSimplexSolver.h, .java: Use change_value for setEditedValue if
	the variable is not in the tableau;  call resolve() before
	removeAllEditVars in endEdit

	* ClSimplexSolver.cc, .java (setExternalVariables): Use change_value
	instead of set_value when so subclasses can override and notice a
	changed variable

Thu Jul 16 19:49:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Added setEditedValue(), FContainsVariable(), and addVar() to c++ 
	and Java implementations

	* Fixed bug in C++ and Java in solvers lacking stay constraints
 	that was due to not-updating the external parametric variables
 	set.

Fri Jul 10 09:00:15 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Fixed bug whereby a dummy variable was being pivoted into the
	basis because pexpr->anyVariable() didn't guarantee the variable
	it returned was a pivotable variable -- now it's called
	anyPivotableVariable(), and does the right thing.

	* Fixed bug whereby column mappings that had no rows remained in
	the list of columns -- now erase the column key when its value is
	the empty set

	* Fixed bug whereby constraints that threw required failure
	exceptions remained in the tableau (a removeConstraint on a
	constraint that failed to be added used to succeed, now it does
	not)

Monday Jun 29 16:50:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Cassowary v0.1 is released  --- see local/POST-ANNOUNCE-TO for
	list of places where it was announced
