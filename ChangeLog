	* Fixed bug whereby a dummy variable was being pivoted into the
	basis because pexpr->anyVariable() didn't guarantee the variable
	it returned was a pivotable variable -- now it's called
	anyPivotableVariable(), and does the right thing.

	* Fixed bug whereby column mappings that had no rows remained in
	the list of columns -- now erase the column key when its value is
	the empty set

	* Fixed bug whereby constraints that threw required failure
	exceptions remained in the tableau (a removeConstraint on a
	constraint that failed to be added used to succeed, now it does
	not)
