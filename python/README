Python Swig Interface specification and Python demonstration/benchmark
applications by Tessa Lau <tlau@cs.washington.edu>.  She also is
responsible for cassowary.py.diff, a hand-written enhancement to the
exposed Python interface.

bench.py is a benchmark program to test its performance, and demo.py is
a demo Python programs to perform the quadrilateral demonstration.
demo-nocns.py is the same demo but without the constraints (for
performance comparison purposes).
