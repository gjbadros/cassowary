Python Swig Interface specification and
Python demonstration/benchmark applications by Tessa Lau <tlau@cs.washington.edu>

At one point the Python wrappers were usable with Python 1.4

bench.py is a benchmark program to test its performance, and demo.py and
demo2.py are demo Python programs to perform the quadrilateral
demonstration.

The Python interface is no longer working (neither with Python 1.4, nor
Python 1.5).  They may be updated in the future to fix the problems that 
currently exist.  If you make these fixes yourself, please pass your
enhancements along to the authors via <cassowary@cs.washington.edu>. Thanks!
