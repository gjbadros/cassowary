WHAT THE DISTRIBUTION CONTAINS

This distribution contains 3 implementations of the Cassowary constraint
solver:

o C++
o Java
o Smalltalk

For each implementation language, there is at least one example program; 
for some there are many.

There is also a SWIG-generated wrapper of the C++ library making the
solver available from the Python language.

A technical report describing the solver, its interface, and its
implementation is in cassowary-tr.ps (pdf version in cassowary-tr.pdf).
This paper is required reading if you intend to use the solver in your
own project(s).


------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO GET STARTED

First, you should try to build the implementation that you're most
interested in.

Note that the included Makefiles depend upon features of GNU Make.  See:

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/

for a version of make that you can build first to then build Cassowary.

Example applications exist in subdirectories of the top-level
implementation subdirectories (e.g., c++/qdemos contains demos for C++
that use the Qt Widget toolkit.

VARIOUS IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

Cassowary/C++ needs to be compiled using a modern C++ compiler.
At one time or another, it has compiled using:
  o egcs-1.0.1, egcs-1.0.3   (likely will work with gcc-2.8.1)
  o Visual C++ 5.0

See c++/README for more details about building the C++ version.


Cassowary/Java was developed using Sun's JDK-1.1.3, ported to Linux
More recent versions should work fine.

See java/README for more details about building the Java version.


Cassowary/Smalltalk was written under OTI Smalltalk-- other versions of
smalltalk will likely require (possibly significant) changes.

See smalltalk/README for more details about the Smalltalk version.


The Python bindings (by Tessa Lau) and experimental guile-scheme
bindings for the Cassowary library are in the wrappers/ subdirectory.
SWIG was used in wrapping the library.
