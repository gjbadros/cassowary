* Specifying constraints interactively
** metaphor
** toolbox

* debugging solutions
** visualization for understanding solution
** unexpected solutions
** bugs

* predicting behaviour
** user studies on expected behaviour
** dynamically changing stay constraint weights to make last moved point least likely to move again
** Resetting of stay constraints -- maybe have last set of stay constraints at a lesser strength makes sense
** Hidden state -> make visible somehow
*** if invisible state matches state in user's head, it's ok
*** if not, it's bad, and need some what to see and manipulate that state

* Compound constraints (x,y for a point satisfied together)

* Disjunctions

* implementation issues
** automatic stays on variables? automatic weighting
** variables connected to a solver

* Detect and remove redundant constraints for efficiency
** especially web application, where constraints are more static

* callbacks for internal happenings
** pivoting

* user-control of choosing alternate solutions
** direct control over, e.g., pivoting
