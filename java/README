Also see ../IMPORTANT for some important notes that you mustn't overlook.

Cassowary/Java was developed using the JDK 1.1.3 port for Linux.  It has 
been tested with JDK 1.1.7 for Linux, also.

Before trying to build Cassowary/Java, be sure to include the directory
java/classes in your CLASSPATH environment variable, e.g., if you untar
the distribution in $HOME, then add: $HOME/cassowary/java/classes to
your $CLASSPATH.  My CLASSPATH looks like this:

/usr/local/.licensed/jdk/lib/classes.zip:/homes/gws/gjb/cassowary/java/classes

Then you can just use `make all' (GNU Make) to build the .class files.  

Try running ClTests after the build completes.  Be sure your CLASSPATH
is set correctly (as discussed above) and do:

java ClTests


The demos/ subdirectory contains the quadrilateral demo;  `make run'
should run it using the appletviewer after building it.


The cda/ subdirectory contains Michael Noth's Constraint Drawing
Application.  `make run' should run it using the appletviewer after
building it.  For more information about the CDA, see:

http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cda/info.html

The CDA is supplied as *unsupported* software.  Feel free to submit bug
reports, etc., but we do not expect to maintain the code.
