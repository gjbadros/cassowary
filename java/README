Cassowary/Java was developed using the JDK 1.1.3 port for Linux.

Before trying to build Cassowary/Java, be sure to include the directory
java/classes in your CLASSPATH environment variable, e.g., if you untar
the distribution in $HOME, then add: $HOME/cassowary/java/classes to
your $CLASSPATH, and be sure "." does not occur before that directory
in your CLASSPATH.  My CLASSPATH looks like this:

/usr/local/.licensed/jdk/lib/classes.zip:/homes/gws/gjb/cassowary/java/classes

Then you can just use `make all' (GNU Make) to build the .class files.  If you
get an error message such as:

  error: File ./CL.java does not contain type CL as expected. Please
  adjust the class path so that the file does not appear in the unnamed
  package.

  ClTests.java:17: Superclass CL of class ClTests not found.
  public class ClTests extends CL {
                               ^
when building ClTests, your CLASSPATH is probably wrong. 

Try running ClTests after the build completes.  Be sure your CLASSPATH
is set correctly (as discussed above) and do:

java ClTests


The demos/ subdirectory contains the quadrilateral demo;  `make run'
should run it using the appletviewer after building it.


The cda/ subdirectory contains Michael Noth's Constraint Drawing
Application.  `make run' should run it using the appletviewer after
building it.  See:
