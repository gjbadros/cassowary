  If any of you were interested in helping test (and providing feedback upon)
my quals project (a constraint-based drawing applet that currently has
no name), I'd much appreciate it.<p>
  How to run it:<p>
  If you have Netscape 4.03 or 4.04 with the "jdk 1.1 enhancements"
you can run the applet from 
http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/noth/Quals/classes/run.html.
Note that the department has Netscape 4.02 installed, so you'll have to 
grab a newer version (*and* the Java upgrade) to have it work that way.

<p>
  If you have access to the 1.1.x JDK (available under Linux on departmental
machines, and maybe even NT in some cases), you can run appletviewer
with the above URL.
<p>
  My desktop box (ikura in 423) is running NT, has the JDK1.1.5 for NT
installed, and has Netscape 4.04 w/ the necessary fiddly bits to run the
applet, if that's more convenient.  I usually work at home, and am virtually
never here in the mornings, so feel free to use ikura then.

<p>
  Notes about it:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Under the Linux 1.1.3 JDK, the icons on the buttons seem to disappear
  after pressing the button.  If that gets really really annoying, 
  forcing a window repaint (covering it with another window, or minimizing
  and restoring it) seems to help.  I don't know why it does that...
<LI>To place an object, use the top 4 buttons (the line, line with
  midpoint, rectangle, and oval).  Click the crosshair cursor to place the
  object, or hit ESC to cancel placement.
<LI>Click on a point to select it (turns green).  Use control + clicking
  to select multiple points.  Click inside the blue box (visible
only when the SHIFT key is down) around an object
  to select all of its associated points at once (the box around the
  selected object will be green, also, instead of the blue box 
  currently used for highlighting)
<LI>The constraints that can be established are:
<UL>
<LI> Anchor constraint:  Point stays where it is.  Select one or more points,
   then click the anchor button to establish anchor constraints on them.
<LI> Colocation constraint:  Point(s) stay together.  Select two or more
   points, then click the colocation button (circle with inward arrows).
<LI> Relational constraints (above, below, left, right):  Object stays
   above/below/left of/right of other object.  The black box on the icon
   represents the "source" object, and the red the target object that
   will stay above/below/etc. the source.  Select an entire object
   (click inside its blue box so all the points are selected), then the
   constraint button, then click the pointing hand cursor on the target
   object.  The constraint is represented by a small red circle in the
   source object and a line going to the center of the target object.
<LI> Alignment constraints (left, right, top, bottom): Objects are aligned
   so that their left/right/top/bottom edge of their bounding boxes are all
   aligned vertically or horizontally (as appropriate).  Select as many whole
   objects (so they are outlined in green) and click on the desired
   alignment button.  The constraint is represented visually as a thin
   grey line along the appropriate edge of the constrained objects.
</UL>

<LI>To delete an object, select it and hit the d key.
<LI>Drag the mouse to get a grey selection box.
<LI>The i key prints some information about the current state of the 
  application.  In particular, you can see how many constraints it's 
  maintaining.
<LI>You can select the visual representation of a constraint with a single 
  click (it gets outlined with a green box).  The d key will delete any 
  selected constraint as well as other objects.
<LI>When dragging a point around, it will snap to other points if the cursor 
  moves within the other point's box.  When released, colocation constraints
  will be established between points that are exactly on top of each other
  (e.g., those that were snapped to).  
</OL>

  If you could play with the applet for a while and 
<a href="mailto:noth@cs.washington.edu">email</a>/tell me what you
think, UI gripes/suggestions, etc., I'd really appreciate it. <p> 

  Thanks in advance!<p>
