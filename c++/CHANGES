List of changes in C++ implementation, from Smalltalk implementation

* Expressions don't convert themselves into constraints via cnEqual,
etc., instead constraints can be constructed from expressions
 - otherwise had a problem with header file inclusion, since I'm trying
   to do as much as possible by value, and avoiding pointers and
   references for efficiency and simplicity

* errorVars is implemented as a map from constraints to a set of ClVariables:
    map<ClConstraint &, set<ClVariable> > my_errorVars;
  values were Arrays;  note that a pair of ClVariable-s may suffice, instead

* eliminated findEditErrorIndex from ClSimplexSolver
 - it's sole use was to find the element to remove from
   the edit variables vectors, which is easier done w/ iterators in C++

* removeParametricVar renamed to removeColumn

Possible Changes
 - implicit stays, add ClStrength to ClVariable -- see p.20 of TR
 - Add edit constraints to solver en masse, after removing old edit
   constraints  -- see p.18 of TR
 - separate out the tableau data structure from the solver
