List of changes in C++ implementation

* Eliminated the ClAbstractVariable hierarchy in favor of a simpler
  ClVariable class with member variables containing the state
 - behaviour wasn't changing for subclasses
 - faster, since no virtual functions
 - con: all ClVariable kinds have a `Number value' field, so some space
   is wasted
 - con: an enum-based implementation that isn't very extensible
 

* Expressions don't convert themselves into constraints via cnEqual,
etc., instead constraints can be constructed from expressions
 - otherwise had a problem with header file inclusion, since I'm trying
   to do as much as possible by value, and avoiding pointers and
   references for efficiency and simplicity


Possible Changes
 - implicit stays, add ClStrength to ClVariable -- see p.20 of TR
 - Add edit constraints to solver en masse, after removing old edit
   constraints  -- see p.18 of TR
 - separate out the tableau data structure from the solver
