Cassowary/C++ needs to be compiled using a modern C++ compiler.
At one time or another, it has compiled using:
  o egcs-1.0.1
  o egcs-1.0.3a
  o egcs-1.1b
      (v0.2 required some modifications:
      comment out last line of ClLinearExpression.cc:
      // template class ClGenericLinearExpression<ClSymbolicWeight>;

      and remove -pedantic from the Makefile's CPPFLAGS variable)
  o gcc-2.8.1 (needs libstdc++-2.8.x, too)
  o Visual C++ 5.0

In particular, Cassowary will *not* build with gcc-2.7.x.x!

Note that with egcs versions between 1.0.1 - 1.0.3 and gcc-2.8.1, the
following warning is ok to ignore:

.../include/g++/std/bastring.h:76: warning: inline function `static void
basic_string<char,string_char_traits<char>,__default_alloc_template<false,0>
>::Rep::operator delete(void *)' called before definition

(If you know how to eliminate this warning, I'd love to hear about it -- 
write me at gjb@cs.washington.edu)


To build, just use GNU make, and "make all" within this directory.

Try running `./ClTests' after the build completes.


The qdemos/ subdirectory contains a demonstration application that
builds using the Qt widget toolkit (cross-platform, free for Unices
only) from:

http://www.troll.no/dl/qtfree-dl.html



The ccc/ subdirectory contains some files that may help you in building
under MS Visual C++ 5.0 (not tested recently--- please feel free to
contribute improved versions).

The demos/ subdirectory contains the ClBoundedQuadDemo (a.k.a. QuadDemo) 
for the wxWindows widget toolkit (cross platform, free everywhere) from:

http://www.wxwindows.org/

(this demo is deprecated, and may not build as easily at the Qt demo in
the qdemos/ subdirectory)
