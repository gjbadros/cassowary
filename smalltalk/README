This directory contains files for a Smalltalk implementation of Cassowary.  

Note that the Smalltalk distribution will be updated only if we know of
people actively using that implementation.  The included Smalltalk
implementation is still at version 0.1, which has at least one bug that
we are aware of.  Please contact <cassowary@cs.washington.edu> if you
would like an update.

A980625.dat is a configuration map for Version 4.44 of Cassowary 
(25 June 1998).  If you are using OTI Smalltalk use this.

Otherwise you can try using the following fileout files:
    ClKernel.app -  the kernel application
    ClTests.app - some small test examples
    ClDemos.app - some graphical demos
You will probably need to make some changes to run these under different
implementations of Smalltalk -- the kernel and the tests will probably port without
too much trouble; the graphical demos would need to be redone.


Here are some statements to execute to open up the graphical demos:

(ClBinaryTreeDemo height: 5)  open.
ClBoxesDemo new open.
ClElasticQuadDemo new open.
ClBoundedQuadDemo new open.
ClQuadDemo new open.
ClBoundedLineDemo new open.
ClLineDemo new open.
