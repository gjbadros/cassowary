19-Feb-1999, Changes since Cassowary v0.23 (for release v0.3)
* Miscellaneious changes
** Updated copyright to include 1999
** Reference Anthony Beurivé's STk wrapper
** Fix Scwm URL

* Changes to Java and C++
** Bug fix for Michael Kaufmann's report (see ChangeLog for details)
** resolve(Vector..) procedure is now depracated;  preferred interface is
suggestValue(...) calls followed by resolve() (the one taking no
arguments).
** Added ClVariable::SetVarMap(..), ClVariable::VarMap() to permit
ClVariable ctr to save the mapping between given name and actual object
in a symbol table (used for parsing ascii expressions in C++ version)

* Changes to just C++ implementation
** Added creader.y, creader.l and function PcnParseConstraint(..) for
creating a constraint from an ASCII string.
** Added CL_NO_IO compile-time option to C++ version for preventing need
to link with the stream library (is not complete)
** Added CL_FIND_LEAK compile-time option for counting ctrs/dtr
invocations
** Added CL_USE_HASH_MAP compile-time option to permit using the GNU
hash_map class instead of the standard STL map (which is a sorted
associative container whose performance for lookups is logarithmic
rather than constant time).  Still does not work for me --02/16/99 gjb.
** Use ClVariable as a handle class to a ClAbstractVariable-- old
ClVariable is now a ClFloatVariable
** Passing ClConstraints's by const & is now deprecated -- pass by
pointer to the ClConstraint object

* Changes to just Java implementation (updated to match changes to C++
version for .2)
** Added {get,set}AttachedObject for ClVariable, ClConstant
** Permit access to ClSimplexSolver.ConstraintMap()
** Permit nested beginEdit()s and handle them correctly


30-Jan-1999, Changes since Cassowary v0.22 (for release v0.23)
* Bug fix (see ChangeLog for details)


23-Jan-1999, Changes since Cassowary v0.21 (for release v0.22)
* Minor code cleanup, additions of comments.


14-Sep-98, Changes since Cassowary v0.2 (for release v0.21)

* Make compile cleanly using egcs-1.1b -- use typename, and drop
  unused templated instantiation

* Improved guile interface: add a void pointer to the solver objects,
  and let the guile wrapper use it to keep a pointer to the scheme-level
  object;  also added clv-attach! and clv-attached-object for attaching
  an object to a cl-variable (somewhat redundant with guile's
  object properties)

* Wrap ClStayConstraints so they can be managed explicitly

* cl-add-stay, cl-add-editvar now take strength and factor arguments,
  instead  of a list of cl-vars

* Added weight option to addEditVar



6-Aug-98, Changes since Cassowary v0.1 (for release v0.2):

* Changes to the distribution for release v0.2

** added guile/scheme wrapper of C++ version

** mention SCWM in README

** mention non-maintenance of Smalltalk implementation unless we have users

* Changes to the C++ and Java implementations

** Fixed several bugs -- dummy variables were wrongly being pivoted into
   the basis, and constraints that threw required failure exceptions
   were mistakenly remaining in the tableau (now trying to remove an
   exception that was not added because of a required-failure exception
   will correctly throw a ConstraintNotFound exception); more -- see ChangeLog

** Added a virtual change_value function to permit applications to watch 
   for changes made to external variables.

* Changes to only the C++ version (Java version will catch up in 0.3)

** Added new test cases to ClTests, fixed bugs in ClTestColumns

** Added _pv (void *) field hanging off of ClConstraint and ClVariable
   for associating arbitrary structs with those (needed by SCWM)

** Permit nested beginEdit()s, and do the right thing upon calling
   endEdit() -- i.e., not all the edit variables are removed, only the
   nested ones

** Permit access to ClSimplexSolver::ConstraintMap() (used by
   guile-wrapper to efficiently get at a list of constraints in the
   solver)

** Added ExCLEditMisuse exception
