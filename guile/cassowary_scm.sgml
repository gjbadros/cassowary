(cl-add-constraint solver . args)
Add the constraints, ARGS, to the solver SOLVER.
Each constraint given after the SOLVER argument is added to that
solver in turn.  Once one cannot be added (e.g., due to its addition
causing an insoluble system), this procedure will return #f without
trying to add the remaining constraints.  If all constraints are added
successfully, this procedure will return #t.  (If none of the
constraints have strength "cls-required", then the system will remain
soluble.)  If an error is signalled because one object in the list ARGS
is not a constraint object, the preceding arguments will have already
been added.

(cl-add-editvar solver . args)
Add edit constraints on variables in ARGS to SOLVER.
ARGS are cl-variable objects that you wish to permit to change under
the solver's control.  An edit-constraint for each cl-variable object
is added in turn.  If any of ARGS is not a cl-variable, an error is
thrown (after the preceding objects have been handled).  After
selecting the edit variables with this procedure, you must call
`cl-begin-edit' before using `cl-suggest-value'.  To remove the edit
variables, use `cl-end-edit' when done changing the variables'
values.

(cl-add-stay solver . args)
Add stay constraints on variables in ARGS to SOLVER.
ARGS are cl-variable objects that you wish to remain (i.e., stay) at
their current values unless another constraint forces them to change.
In normal uses of the solver, all variables should have stay
constraints added on them before they are used in a constraint added
to the solver.  Future versions of the solver may add the stay
constraint implicitly upon a variable's first use.  Until then,
though, be sure to add stay constraints on all the cl-variable objects
you intend to use with the given SOLVER.

(cl-begin-edit solver)
Begin changing values of the edit variables of SOLVER.
This procedure must be invoked after adding edit variables to SOLVER
(via `cl-add-editvar') and before using `cl-suggest-values' to change
those edit variables' values.  Every `cl-begin-edit' invocation should
have a matching `cl-end-edit' call.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:1301]


(cl-constraint-list solver #&optional internal-also?)
Return the list of constraints in SOLVER.
Each object in the returned list is a cl-constraint object (i.e.,
it is either a cl-linear-equation or a cl-inequality). If
INTERNAL-ALSO? is #f or not given, then only the constraints added via
the guile interface will be listed.  If INTERNAL-ALSO? is #t, then all
constraints added to the solver (even those added by primitive code
directly) will be listed.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:1438]


(cl-constraint? obj)
Return #t if OBJ is some kind of constraint object, #f otherwise.
There are at least two kinds of objects for which this procedure will
return #t: "cl-inequality" and "cl-equation" objects.  Since it is
often useful to treat either as a general constraint, this procedure
exists to simplify that test.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:956]


(cl-divide exprA exprB)
Return the cl-expression that is the quotient of EXPRA and EXPRB.
Both EXPRA and EXPRB may be cl-expression objects or cl-variable
objects. Note that the product may not introduce non-linear terms--
if it does (e.g., if EXPRA and EXPRB both contain the same
cl-variable), an error will result.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:618]


(cl-end-edit solver)
Finish changing the values of the edit variables in SOLVER.
This procedure must be invoked once for every invocation of
`cl-begin-edit'.   It will force a final re-solve before removing
any edit variables that have been added via `cl-add-editvar'.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:1322]


(cl-equation? obj)
Return #t if OBJ is a constraint equation, #f otherwise.
Constraint equations also respond #t to `cl-constraint?' queries,
since they are also constraint objects.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:710]


(cl-expression? obj)
Return #t if OBJ is a constraint expression, #f otherwise.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:450]


(cl-inequality? obj)
Return #t if OBJ is a constraint inequality object, #t otherwise.
Constraint inequalities also respond #t to `cl-constraint?' queries,
since they are also constraint objects.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:870]


(cl-int-value clv)
Return the value of the constraint variable CLV as an integer.
Internally, the value is a double.  This rounds that real number to
an integer before returning the value.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:184]


(cl-minus exprA exprB)
Return the cl-expression that is the difference of EXPRA and EXPRB.
Both EXPRA and EXPRB may be cl-expression objects or cl-variable
objects.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:541]


(cl-plus exprA exprB)
Return the cl-expression that is the sum of EXPRA and EXPRB.
Both EXPRA and EXPRB may be cl-expression objects or cl-variable
objects.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:507]


(cl-remove-constraint solver . args)
Remove the constraints, ARGS, from the solver SOLVER.
Each constraint given after the SOLVER argument is removed from that
solver in turn.  Once one cannot be removed (e.g., due to its never
having been added to SOLVER), this procedure will return #f without
trying to remove the remaining constraints.  If all constraints are
removed successfully, this procedure will return #t.  If an error is
signalled because one object in the list ARGS is not a constraint
object, the preceding arguments will have already been removed.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:1181]


(cl-resolve solver . args)
Ask SOLVER to re-solve its system using the suggested values.
You may only call this procedure between invocations of
`cl-begin-edit' and `cl-end-edit'.  After `cl-begin-edit', you may use
`cl-suggest-value' on SOLVER to tell it the desired new values for the
various edit variables you have added using `cl-add-editvar', and then
call this procedure with only the first argument to have SOLVER update
the values of all the variables in the system.
Alternatively, after adding edit-variables in a particular order, you
may call `cl-begin-edit' then this procedure with ARGS set as
suggested values for the edit-variables.  The order of the values in
the `cl-resolve' invocation must match the order of the variables in
the `cl-add-editvar' invocation(s).
In either case, you must invoke `cl-end-edit' to remove the edit
variables from the solver after you are done changing their values.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:1382]


(cl-solver-debug-print solver #&optional port)
Output a complete dump of SOLVER onto output port PORT.
The output contains the contents of the tableau contained in SOLVER,
as well as the other internal state.  It can be useful for debugging,
as the printable form of constraint solver objects contains only a
brief summary of the contents of the solver.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:1081]


(cl-solver? obj)
Return #t if OBJ is a constraint solver object, #f otherwise.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:1108]


(cl-strength? obj)
Return #t if OBJ is a constraint strength, #f otherwise.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:321]


(cl-suggest-value solver var value)
Try to change VAR's value to VALUE within SOLVER.
You may only call this procedure after using `cl-add-editvar' to add
VAR as an edit variable for SOLVER, and after invoking `cl-begin-edit'
on SOLVER.  After you call `cl-begin-edit', you may invoke this
procedure on all the edit variables.  The changing of the values of
those variables (and the affect on other variables within SOLVER) will
not happen until after invoking `cl-resolve' on SOLVER.  Then the
possibly changed values can be retrieved via `cl-value' or
`cl-int-value'.  Note that the constraints that have been added to
SOLVER may not permit changing VAR to VALUE.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:1343]


(cl-times exprA exprB)
Return the cl-expression that is the product of EXPRA and EXPRB.
Both EXPRA and EXPRB may be cl-expression objects or cl-variable
objects.  Note that the product may not introduce non-linear terms--
if it does (e.g., if EXPRA and EXPRB both contain the same
cl-variable), an error will result.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:575]


(cl-value clv)
Return the current value of the constraint variable CLV.
The value is a double.  Use `cl-int-value' to return an integer.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:168]


(cl-variable? obj)
Return #t if OBJ is a constraint variable, #f otherwise.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:116]


(cl-weight? obj)
Return #t if OBJ is a constraint weight object, #f otherwise.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:240]


(make-cl-constraint exprA op exprB #&optional strength factor)
Return a newly-constructed constraint object.
EXPRA and EXPRB are cl-expression or cl-variable objects.  OP is one
of `=', `<=', or `>=', anything else will signal an error.  Note that
the arithmetic comparison procedures are just used for their identity.
The returned object is a cl-equation constraint object if OP is `=';
it is a cl-inequality constraint object if OP is `<=' or `>='.  The
created constraint is given strength STRENGTH, a cl-strength, and has
a weight factor of FACTOR, a real number.  STRENGTH defaults to
cls-required, FACTOR defaults to 1.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:970]


(make-cl-equality exprA exprB #&optional strength factor)
Return a newly-created constraint equation.
The resulting constraint is that EXPRA is equal to EXPRB.  EXPRA and
EXPRB are cl-expression or cl-variable objects.  The constraint is
given strength STRENGTH, a cl-strength, and has a weight factor of
FACTOR, a real number.  STRENGTH defaults to cls-required, FACTOR
defaults to 1.  Consider `make-cl-constraint' as a higher-level
interface to building arbitrary constraints.
This is a convenience procedure that has the same
semantics as `make-cl-equation' with the difference of EXPRA and
EXPRB.  Note that if neither expression contains a variable, an
error will be signalled.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:759]


(make-cl-equation expr #&optional strength factor)
Return a newly-created constraint equation.
The resulting constraint is that EXPR is equal to 0.  EXPR is a
cl-expression or cl-variable object.  The constraint is given strength
STRENGTH, a cl-strength, and has a weight factor of FACTOR, a real
number.  STRENGTH defaults to cls-required, FACTOR defaults to 1.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:721]


(make-cl-expression clv)
Return a newly-create constraint expression object.
The expression is contains just the value CLV.  Often constraint
variables can be used interchangeably with constraint expressions, but
this procedure can be used to force building a simple expression.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:459]


(make-cl-inequality exprA op exprB #&optional strength factor)
Return a newly-constructed constraint inequality object.
EXPRA and EXPRB are cl-expression or cl-variable objects.  If OP is
`<=' then the constraint is that EXPRA <= EXPRB; if OP is `>=' then
the constraint is that EXPRA >= EXPRB.  Note that the arithmetic
comparison procedure objects are just used for their identity. If OP
is any other object, an error is signalled. The constraint is given
strength STRENGTH, a cl-strength, and has a weight factor of FACTOR, a
real number.  STRENGTH defaults to cls-required, FACTOR defaults to 1.
Consider `make-cl-constraint' as a higher-level interface to building
arbitrary constraints.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:881]


(make-cl-solver)
Return a newly-created constraint solver object.
Often, an application will need only one of these objects,  but
multiple independent solvers may exist as long as they do not
share constraint variable objects.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:1117]


(make-cl-strength name weight)
Return a newly-created constraint strength object.
The object is given the name NAME, a string, and the symbolic
strengh WEIGHT, a cl-weight.  Constraint strength objects
are used when specifying the strength of a constraint.  There are
several predefined cl-strenght objects: "cls-required", "cls-strong",
"cls-medium", and "cls-weak".  These four constraint strengths
are often enough for a suitably expressive constraint-hierarchy,
but new strengths can be introduced if necessary.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:344]


(make-cl-strength-3 name w1 w2 w3)
Return a newly-created constraint strength object.
The object is given the name NAME, a string, and a symbolic weight of
length three with the sequence of values: W1, W2, W3.  This is a
convenience procedure that has the same semantics as building a
cl-weight object with the values and using that to build a cl-strength
object.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:374]


(make-cl-variable  #&optional name value)
Return a newly-created constraint variable.
The created variable has the name NAME, and an initial
value of VALUE.  Be sure to add a stay constraint on the
variable if you want its value to not change.
[From cassowary_scm.cc:125]


(make-cl-weight w1 w2 w3)
Return a newly-created constraint symbolic weight object.
Symbolic weights are sequences of real numbers that are sorted
in lexicographical order (e.g., 1,0,0 > 0,999,999).  cl-weight
objects are used when creating cl-strength objects.  By convention,
the sequences are three elements long: W1, W2, and W3.  Longer
cl-weight objects could be supported in the future.  See also
`make-cl-strength-3' which is a convenience procedure for building a
cl-strength object given the sequence of numbers directly.
