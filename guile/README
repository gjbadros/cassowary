See ../README for general information and generic instructions.
Also see ../LICENSE for legalese regarding use of this distribution.
Also see ../IMPORTANT for some important notes that you mustn't overlook.

This directory contains the source code to a wrapping of cassowary for
use with guile scheme.

Be sure to run configure in the top level directory with
the "--enable-guile-build" option to do exactly that.

See cassowary_scm-procedures.txt for a list of the scheme procedures
that are defined, or cassowary_scm.sgml for an SGML markup of that
documentation (follows the DocBook DTD -- use Jade to convert to HTML).
Also see cassowary_scm-variables.txt for a list of the scheme global
variables that are defined.

cltests.scm is a test script.  *AFTER* installing the distribution, you
can run it using "guile -s cltests.scm".  If you want to test before
doing the install, try "make test" from this guile subdirectory.  (This
may not be necessary with all versions of guile as "." may be implicit
in the GUILE_LOAD_PATH already.)

This wrapping was motivated by the desire to embed Cassowary in Scwm --
the Scheme Constraints Window Managers.  See:

http://scwm.mit.edu
