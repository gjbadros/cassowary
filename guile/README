This directory contains the source code to a wrapping of cassowary for
use with guile scheme.

See cassowary_scm-procedures.txt for a list of the scheme procedures
that are defined, or cassowary_scm.sgml for an SGML markup of that
documentation (follows the DocBook DTD -- use Jade to convert to HTML).

This wrapping was motivated by the desire to embed Cassowary in SCWM --
the Scheme Constraints Window Managers.  See:

http://web.mit.edu/mstachow/www/scwm.html
