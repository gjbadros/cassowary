Cassowary/C++ needs to be compiled using a modern C++ compiler.
At one time or another, it has compiled using:
  o egcs-1.0.1, egcs-1.0.3, gcc-2.8.1
  o Visual C++ 5.0

Cassowary/Java was developed using Sun's JDK-1.1.3, ported to Linux
More recent versions should work fine.

The included Makefiles depend upon features of GNU Make.  See:

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/

for a version that you can build.


To build the c++/qdemos/QuadDemo application, you'll need TrollTech's Qt
widget set for X11, available from:

See also the SCWM (Scheme Constraints Window Manager) web page for a use 
of Cassowary in a substantial application:
