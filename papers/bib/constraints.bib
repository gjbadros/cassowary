% the copy of this file on /projects/weird/constraints.bib is under RCS control
%
% ======================================================================
% The file should always be readable by anyone.  Normally it won't have
% write permission set, though.  To edit it, you need to first check out 
% the file by typing:
%     co -l constraints.bib
% The -l option stands for "lock" - otherwise you won't be able to edit it.
% (To check out the file, you need to be on the access control list.) 
% 
% When you're done editing the file check it back in by typing
%     ci -u constraints.bib
% (The program will prompt you for a log message.)
% The -u option is important -- otherwise RCS will erase the working
% version of the file and just keep it in its private RCS directory, rather
% than leaving a read-only version in /projects/weird

    constraints have priorities, and are solved from strongest to weakest 
    by an ad-hoc algorithm.  Constraints can include: which windows must 
    be present on the screen, their size and location, adjacency and 
    alignment requirements, limits on the ways that the system may change 
    the layout (stability), and particular organizations of windows on 
    the screen.  Other interesting features include constraint strength 
    aging, window peeking and silver, and window families (groups of 
    related windows). Good paper.}}
